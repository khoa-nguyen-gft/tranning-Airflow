# Simple Tink AEAD Encryption Example

This is a tutorial that demonstrates how to encrypt data using the AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) primitive in Tink.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed
- Tink library installed (can be installed using `pip install tink`)
- Read and Understand the file [003-ciphertext.py](./003-ciphertext.py)


## Run the Code
Save the file and run it using the command `python 003-ciphertext.py`. The output should include the generated ciphertext.

Note: Remember to handle the encryption key securely and store it appropriately to ensure the security of your encrypted data.
