# Lab Practies Apache Beam

- [`001-department-pipeline.py`](./001-department-pipline.py): This module introduces the concept of pipelines and how they are used in data processing. It covers basic pipeline setup and execution.

- [`002-DoFn.py`](./002-DoFn.py): This module explores the concept of DoFns (Do Functions) in Apache Beam. It covers different types of DoFns and their usage.

- [`003-branching-pipeline.py`](./003-branching-pipline.py): This module covers branching pipelines, where data can be split into multiple paths for parallel processing or conditional branching.

- [`004-DoAvgListNumber.py`](./004-DoAvgListNumber.py): This module focuses on working with lists and performing operations like averaging on the elements of a list using Apache Beam.

- [`005-transform.py`](./005-transform.py): This module introduces various transformations available in Apache Beam, such as mapping, filtering, and grouping, and demonstrates their usage.

- [`006-beam-coGroupBy.py`](./006-beam-coGroupBy.py): This module explains the coGroupBy operation in Apache Beam, which allows combining multiple PCollections based on a common key.

- [`007-FilterUsingLength.py`](./007-FilterUsingLength.py): This module demonstrates how to filter data based on the length of elements in Apache Beam, providing an example of advanced filtering techniques.

- [`108-ProcessWords.py`](./108-ProcessWords.py):  This module focuses on processing words using Apache Beam. It covers tasks like counting word occurrences, applying transformations, and aggregating results.


- Each module can consist of a combination of theoretical explanations, code walkthroughs, and hands-on exercises. The training can be delivered in a workshop format, where participants can follow along with the provided code examples and perform exercises to reinforce their understanding.
